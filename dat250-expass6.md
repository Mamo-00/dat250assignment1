### Technical Problems?
There were no technical problems although it was hard trying to figure out how to use the angular 
libraries as it is completely new to me and i am so used to using the react library, so changing my way of doing things
when developing websites was a challenge. Like i literally had to look up how to do every single thing because it was so much
different from how you would do it in react where i thought there was a lot of similarities when there it technically is not that 
many similarities at all.
