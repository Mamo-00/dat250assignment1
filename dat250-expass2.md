### Where is the database? Explain the used database and how/when it runs.
The database used in this project is an H2 database from which you can know by looking
at the dialect used in the persistence.xml:
```
<property name="hibernate.dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect"/>
```
and also the driver that is used which is the JDBC driver for H2 databases:
```
<property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class" value="org.h2.Driver"/>
```

This database runs by Hibernate first looking for the persistence.xml and reads the configuration
and sets up the persistence unit which in our case is named jpa-tutorial.
```
<persistence-unit name="jpa-tutorial" transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL">
```
Then the entity manager refers to the persistence unit to pull in the configurations
```
EntityManagerFactory factory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(PERSISTENCE_UNIT_NAME);
```
and the CRUD operations are done within transactions which is managed by the entity manager
and is configured through this attribute: transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL.

### Can you provide the SQl used to create the table Customer?

Thee SQL used to create the Customer table can be found by reading the logs that show up
when you turn this property in the persistence.xml to true
```
<property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true"/>
```
by reading the console window I got this result:
```
Hibernate: 
    create table Customer (
        id bigint generated by default as identity,
        name varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )
```

## Technical problems that I encountered
One problem that I can remember that I encountered and it was during the testing.
For some reason the test case was expecting some of the setters to take in Set class as parameters but the
unfinished code in the exercise used Collection class so the tests were failing, but once I changed the 
parameters to take in Sets instead the tests were good to go.

Other difficulties was establishing the correct relations between the tables inside the code and figure out the
right type of relationship and whether to use join column or not, but as I was coding it became clearer and clearer
for me.

### an explanation of how you inspected the database tables and what tables were created.
I was not able to inspect the database as I had trouble figuring out how. The Database tab in intelliJ
was not able to connect to the data source and I was getting this error:
```
[HY000][50000] General error: "The write format 3 is larger than the supported format 2 [2.1.210/5]"
[50000-210] The write format 3 is larger than the supported format 2 [2.1.210/5].
```
I tried updating to the lastest stable driver which is 2.1.210 and i do not no what i am missing in terms of driver
or what format 2 or 3 is. 

The only thing I can do is figure out the database schema by looking at the create or join statement in the sql
that shows up when i turn the show_sql attribute to true.

### any pending issues with this assignment that you did not manage to solve?
The only issues are the ones I explained in the previous question about inspecting the database.
