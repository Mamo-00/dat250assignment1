## Technical difficulties

I would not have the jakarta persistence packages automatically downloaded so i would have to download them,
and sometimes building the executable jar would fail because it would not run on java 17 so i would have to upgrade to java 20 or higher. Also putting my code into a 
repository is always a hassle because of unrelated history error when merging with the repository on github 
(which is also why i just added the results from experiment 3 and 4 instead of trying to add the code to a repository)
